### Brewery is a Plugin for an alternate brewing process, including alcoholic Potions.

Works with Spigot, Paper, and Folia from `1.21.8` to `1.8.9`!

The somewhat difficult brewing process rewards you with a diversity of Potions, which, through their effects, create a drunkenness that has never existed in Minecraft before.
